## Project Summary
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This project is required to complete the requirements Frontend Nanodegree by Udacity, it aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

## Development Strategy
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- I started by cloning the starter code provided by Udacity.
- Then I added my design (colors, font style, and some other) from my last project, since I preferred to unify my works
- Added a function to create navigation list dynamically.
- Added functionality to distinguish the section in view.
- Added the functionality to scroll to sections.
